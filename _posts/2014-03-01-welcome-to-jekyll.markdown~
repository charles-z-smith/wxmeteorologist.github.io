This is my first blog post and I am rather excited given how much effor it took me to get the right version of ruby to correctly install.  Given that I am rather a Linux newbie,  installing things from source was slightly intimidating at first, but finally getting this working on github is worth it.

I plan to post topics ranging from meteorology to computer science and perhaps the combination between the two.
